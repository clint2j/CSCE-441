Programming Assignment 1
by Clint Hart

Features Not Completed:
None

Extra Credit Features (2/2):
I implemented both a spray brush (when s is pressed) and a circular brush (when b is pressed). 

Note: The spray brush command is over the circular vs square brush command, so when s is pressed, spray mode is entered, and when s is pressed again, it will leave spray mode and reenter whichever brush shape was previously used.
