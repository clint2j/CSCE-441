Notes:
    1. To switch between the spheres and the bunny, click 1 for the first view and 2 for the second view. Note that the views will only render once, so after they've rendered it should be instantaneous
    2. A "../resources" (or a reference to wherever your resource file is) must be passed as a cmd arg
    3. I didn't finish the bounding box, so the bunny should take a bit to load
